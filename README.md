##This is a repsitiory of programming challenges I'm using to learn Python. 

#####The challenges come from [Reddit's Daily Programmer Challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges). I will following them in chronlogical order, of courses doing the easy challenges first. I will attempt the extra portions of challenges well. I quote the challenges

1. [Challenge 1: Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/pih8x/easy_challenge_1/) "Create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank), for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later."

2. [Challenge 2: Easy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/pjbj8/easy_challenge_2/) "Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs, so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be something that you can use in the classroom. For example, if you were in physics class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.

EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!"
