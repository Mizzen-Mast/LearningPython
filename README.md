##This is a repsitiory of programming challenges I'm using to learn Python. 

#####The challenges come from [Reddit's Daily Programmer Challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges). I will following them in chronlogical order, of courses doing the easy challenges first. I will attempt the extra portions of challenges well.

1.
